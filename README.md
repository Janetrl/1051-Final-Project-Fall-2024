I skimmed around the Ren'Py overview page that appears on the screen when Ren'Py is downloaded.

Assets from:

  Everything was for public usage

Difficulties:
I didn't complete my original vision. However, in the time I had left from where I was at and what I already had accomplished, I say I've come quite far.
Labels were hard to understand but skimming through Ren'Py's overwiew pages I found everything a bit easier to do.
Scenes, music, and sound were hard to transition so I did what I could to make the game not seem so rough.

Learned:
Playing around with the functions help my learning a lot. I kept playing around when I got stuck and frustrated and sometimes that was the answer.

Enjoyed:
I enjoyed drawing Luz and Ant. I wish I had the motivation to draw various versions of them to incorporate into the game but overall I say their neutral expression was fine to be the only expression included. 
It matched the overall vibe.
I don't like writing academically but for myself, that is a different story. I had many hurdles with this story (I kept changing it) but in the end I think I found a proper way to make it flow and stay coherent. 
It was nice to not be forced to write something (I chose thise upon for myself)
